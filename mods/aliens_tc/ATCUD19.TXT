AL|ENS-TOTAL CONVERSION for Ultimate DOOM v1.9
==============================================

This is an update of the ATC program for DOOM v1.9, updated for use with
Ultimate DOOM v1.9.

I did not create the ATC module itself, merely modified it for use with
Ultimate DOOM.  Give credit to Justin Fisher, he's the one who did all the
work.  :)

NOTE:  The ATCUD19.ZIP archive contains the DEHACKED.EXE (DeHackEd v3.0a) and 
a custom DEHACKED.INI file for use by the ATC install program.  If you keep
these files in the same place your DOOM files are, be sure to back them up!

To install:  Unzip the ATCUD19.ZIP file in your DOOM directory, then run the
INSTALL.BAT batch file.

Afterwards, you may run the DELINST.BAT batch file to remove all files left
over from the installation procedure.  This is optional.

Any questions about this install program, please contact me at:

Any questions about ATC, please don't contact me, contact Justin Fisher.

-Enjoy-
