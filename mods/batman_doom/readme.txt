     	Thank you for obtaining Batman DOOM. This is the complete version
that replaces almost all the features you can find in DOOM2. This game took
the efforts of three years of hard work so we would appreciate if you mail
us sending your comments and impressions (see our mail below). Remember you
can always get more info of Batman DOOM at our web site (see below). Enjoy!
          
	For more information e-mail us at: ebordeu@rdc.cl
     
	Our web site is at: http://www.doomworld.com/batman/main.shtml

     	Some important info:
     
	Batman DOOM's multiplayer game was never tested due to time limits.
If you find any significant bugs in multiplayer or solo play please e-mail
us.
     	Also, Batman DOOM has a new feature: if you play in "Nightmare"
(Knightfall) monsters will not respawn like in DOOM. We considered that
this would enable the Nightmare level to be playable. But because of this
we had to sacrifice the kill percent in the game. So don't be alarmed when
you see that the kill percent is missing and a zero is at the upper right
of the screen. We just couldn't figure how to erase that zero, so it will
always appear. See if you can beat Batman DOOM in Knightfall; it's a great
challenge!

for his tremendous efforts for the game.
                        
-Anthony Soto for making Batman DOOM possible in the largest gaming

	Tips & Fun stuff:

a) Each Batcave has a hidden secret! See if you can find them all.

b) Where is Wally? We're sure he's hidden somewhere in Gotham. Can you
find him?

c) In level 15 you must rescue major Kroll from the Scarecrow. Depending
on if you're succesfull or not you will take a different path in the game.

d) Batman DOOM has a secret level. A pretty bizarre one :)
