Description             : Doom 64 maps recreated or reimagined with vanilla
                          Doom II assets, and made to run within the
                          original vanilla limits.  Not all maps are
                          perfect recreations; the goal was to recreate
                          the major aspects of the maps while allowing for
                          creative liberties where needed or wanted.

                          In addition to the maps, there are some new 
                          graphics, new sky textures, a few new textures
                          where needed, some new music tracks, and a few
                          new monsters.

                          This project was a community effort and was
                          started by Death Egg in May 2013.  Sometime
                          later the project was handed off to BaronOfStuff
                          but was abandoned not too long after that.
                          In February 2017, Death Egg stepped back in to
                          hand the project's leadership over to Mechadon,
                          and it was finished a year and a half later.

                          BaronOfStuff for helping keep the project alive
                          after Death Egg couldn't.

                          CoTeCiO and Nevander for helping put together
                          builds before the project was reorganized and

                          more obscure dehacked changes, doing some
                          excellent work prettying up the sky textures,
                          helping with the blank sfx, and doing a bunch
                          of other helpful things!

                          Cage for doing some amazing graphic work

                          super busy.  And a HUGE thanks for the brand
                          new Motherdemon sprites (which he made from
                          scratch by the way)!

                          Devalaous for helping come up with the final

* Play Information *

Game                    : Doom 2
Map #                   : MAP01 - MAP32 (+MAP33 as a bonus)
Single Player           : Designed for
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Designed for
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Player starts only
Other game styles       : None
Difficulty Settings     : Yes
Additional Notes        : If you're playing in Chocolate Doom, be sure to
                          apply the .deh file and use -merge.

                          MAP02B, MAP19B, MAP27B, and MAP30B are the map
                          lump names for the Boom-format variants of those
                          particular maps.  Use those names when warping
                          to them via console or command line.

                          MAP33 can only be warped to, there is no exit
                          that leads to it.  Some ports will allow you
                          to use idclev, but others may require that you
                          use the -warp command or the console.

                          MAP11, MAP21, MAP26, MAP29, and MAP30 can not
                          be exited when using the -nomonsters flag.  This
                          is because the Cyberdemon(s)/Motherdemon
                          (on MAP30) must be killed in order to progress.

                          If you see a sign that says 'COOP', this means
                          that the switch or teleporter is meant for
                          cooperative play (for areas that other players
                          might get locked out of).  I did my best to hide
                          them from the player in singleplayer games, but
                          you may still notice a couple of them.


* Construction *

Base                    : Some maps directly based off of their Doom 64
                          counterparts, others are recreated from scratch.
Build Time              : 5 years & 2 months
Editor(s) used          : Doom Builder 2, GZDoom Builder, SLADE, XWE,
                          WhackEd4, GIMP, Photoshop, playscii, DoomWriter,
                          Audacity, Google Docs, FL Studio, Guitar Pro 5.2,
                          Anvil Studio, 3DS Studio Max
Known Bugs              : Voodoo doll setups make use of an exploding
                          object to push the player object.  This causes
                          the player to take a small amount of damage,
                          meaning it's possible that a player could be
                          killed out of the blue or put into an undead
                          state.  We have tried to mitigate this possiblity
                          as much as possible, but it could still happen.

                          A few maps have seg overflows in areas, but they
                          should be pretty hard to spot for the most part.

                          Mouselook may make certain shootable triggers
                          too easy to hit or may break something.  Playing
                          with mouselook is discouraged if it allows you
                          to fire weapons in the direction you look.

                          Some maps make use of instant raise/lower
                          sectors.  Because it's possible to do linedef
                          skips accidentally, you may run into areas
                          where the floor may not raise/lower properly.
                          You should still be able to continue with the
                          map when this occurs though.

                          Saving/Loading may break in some maps because
                          of vanilla limits.  This shouldn't be a problem
                          if played in an advanced port.

                          MAP33's name will show up as 'Congo' in some
                          ports.  This is a limitation of the dehacked
                          format, so just ignore it.

                          The Nightmare Imp will not make a melee attack
                          sound in vanilla.  This is a limitation of the
                          dehacked and not a bug.  It was given a melee
                          attack sound in (G)ZDoom-based ports as a
                          quality-of-life change.

                          The wide-screen version of the statusbar may
                          not work in all ports.  I don't know if this
                          is a problem with the statusbar, or if it's a
                          lack of support issue.

                          In the end-game casting call in (G)ZDoom ports,
                          the Motherdemon's sight sound will get cut off
                          as she does her attack animation.  This seems to
                          be a limitation with how the engine handles UI
                          sound effects.

                          For the end-game casting call in certain ports
                          (Vanilla/Chocolate, PrBoom+), the Motherdemon's
                          attack sound is the chaingun.  This appears to be
                          hardcoded behavior and thus cannot be changed.

                          ZDaemon has a few issues:
                              - There are some visual errors that may pop
                                up in some maps (ie. MAP30).
                              - Some music tracks were reported as not
                                playing back correctly.
                              - The end game text won't display.
                              - The warping fire sky textures do not work.
